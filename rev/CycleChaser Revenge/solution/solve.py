# Writeup/Solve script for "CycleChaser Revenge" for KalmarCTF 2023
# by shalaamum

# This writeup build on top of the writeup for "CycleChaser", so read that one
# first. For that challenge one had to "invert" Collatz sequences in the sense
# that one had to construct an integer where the first SEQUENCELEN_RANDOM +
# FLAGLEN steps of the Collatz sequence starting with that integer would have
# prescribed type (odd or even). In the "CycleChaser" having SEQUENCELEN_RANDOM
# even steps at the start and then FLAGLEN odd steps was enough, so it was only
# necessary to solve this very special case of the more general problem.
# For this challenge additional restrictions were imposed in order to force the
# player to figure out an efficient solution to the more general problem.  As
# last time we will want the last FLAGLEN steps to be odd in order the have the
# flag be xored into flag_enc. However, we can not avoid xoring bytes from the
# random pool into flag_enc, as each of the random bytes is allowed to occur at
# an even step a maximum of FLAGLEN times, and furthermore each byte of
# flag_enc must have been xored into an odd number of times by *some* random
# byte. At which step which random byte occurs is randomized and different at
# each run, to force players to find an efficient solution that works in the 300
# seconds timeout, but the order is not secret as we provide the seed of the
# random number generator to the player at the start. An additional restriction
# is that the program will abort should any of the intermediate values obtained
# during calculation of the Collatz sequence become too large.  This forces us
# to be careful not to have too many odd steps at the start.

# So there are two main steps to solving this challenge: Figuring out a sequence
# of odd/even that will produce an flac_enc from which the flag can be efficiently
# extracted by locally bruteforcing as few bytes as possible, and then finding
# a start value that will produce a Collatz sequence whose steps are exactly
# of the prescribed type.

# Inverting Collatz sequences

# So given a sequence of n values "odd"/"even", how do we find an integer v
# such that the type of the first n steps of its Collatz sequence will be odd
# or even as prescribed by the sequence?

# The claim in the writeup for "CycleChaser" tells us already that if such an
# integer v exists, we will be able to find one with 0 <= v < 2**n.  This
# suggests as a first solution to just try all 2**n possible v's and see which
# one has the correct Collatz sequence. Unfortunately the runtime for this
# bruteforcing solution explodes so fast that this is not feasible except for
# very small n, and certainly not for n=131136 (which is what n is in the case
# of the challenge). However, as discussed in the writeup for "CycleChaser",
# that claim also tells us that we can construct v bit by bit.  We start by
# figuring out which first bit (the least significant one) would result in the
# correct type of first Collatz step. After we found it, we try out the two
# possibilities for the second bit, having already fixed the first one, and
# check which one will make the first two Collatz steps of the correct type (we
# already know the first one will be), and so on.  When checking bit i, we will
# have to check two choices, and in each of those we will have to evaluate i
# Collatz steps. This results in roughly quadratic runtime in n (here and in
# the following let us ignore that bigger numbers also take longer to add and
# multiply, as that is not super relevant to the discussion). We can improve
# this method a bit by first noting that if the i-th bit is taken to be 0, then
# the number we are checking is the same one as the one we considered in the
# i-1-th step, so by remembering what the i-1--th value in its Collatz sequence
# was, we need only calculate one more step, rather than having to also
# recalculate the i-1 first steps. This will cut runtime roughly in half, but
# runtime is still quadratic.

# We can do better still if we realize that if we remember the value in the
# Collatz sequence after i-1 steps when starting with v, then we can also
# predict the value after i-1 steps when starting with v + 2**(i-1), with only
# a little extra information we need to remember from the first i-1 steps.
# For this, let us take v and consider how the next value in the Collatz
# sequence changes if we replace v by v + a*(2**k), with k>0.
# If v is even (and hence so will be v + a*(2**k)), then the next values will
# be v/2 and (v + a*(2**k))/2 = v/2 + a*(2**(k-1))
# If v is odd, the next values will be
# (3*v + 1) / 2 and
# (3*(v + a*(2**k)) + 1) / 2 = 3*(v+1)/2 + (3*a*(2**k))/2 = 3*(v+1)/2 + 3*a*(2**(k-1))
# The upshot is that the "extra summand" will carry through to a new "extra
# summand" but with the exponent of 2 reduced by 1, and in the odd case we also
# multiply by 3.  So this means that if starting with v we get after i-1 steps
# the value v', then starting with v + 2**(i-1) we will after i-1 steps get
# v' + 3**num_odd instead, where num_odd is the number of odd steps in those
# i-1 Collatz steps. This suggests the algorithm implemented in the following
# function to compute a startvalue for a Collatz sequence where the type of the
# first n steps is prescribed, with linear runtime in n if we ignore that
# arithmetic with larger numbers takes longer.

# When constructing the challenge, I tested all three algorithms suggested here
# (with simple Python implementations) and plotted their runtime.  The pictures
# should be available alongside this writeup. The sequence length of 131136
# (which is 2**17 plus 64 for the flag) was chosen for the challenge to make it
# possible to find a solution with the efficient algorithm described here
# easily in the timeout (i.e. a simple Python solution runs in a few seconds,
# so no need to implement with more efficient programming languages etc.) but
# not with less efficient algorithms, and with sufficient buffer to make it
# very clear to players that so far only found a less efficient algorithm that
# the task is to keep looking for a better algorithm rather than implementing
# it in C or Rust and hiring a big cluster.

# Note that the claim that was proven in the writeup for CycleChaser shows that
# map Z -> {0,1}^n that maps each integer v to (c_1, ..., c_n) with c_i being 1
# iff the i-th Collatz step starting from v is odd, factors through Z/2^n.  The
# algorithm that was described above is a constructive proof for the existence
# of a right inverse to this map, so as both domain and codomain have 2^n
# elements this is a bijection.

# indicates that the i-th step should be an odd one.
