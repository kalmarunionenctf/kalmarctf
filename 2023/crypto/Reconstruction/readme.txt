CTFd_description:
```
Shamir agreed to keep my flag secret for me in his stronghold. He assured me that the adversary would never cross its threshold. But the adversary commanded vast legions, and broke through to the threshold. There remains only one defense against reconstruction. Note: This challenge requires some extended computation. Our (very unoptimised) solve script terminates in under 30 minutes :)
