`.uf2` is a flashing format created by Microsoft to flash microcontrollers ([GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/uf2)). It is used by Lego as the format to flash the Lego Mindstorm ev2 which is the controller for the robot used in the chal see [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJRel3cX5GQ).

Simplest way to create a `.uf2` file for the Lego Mindstorm ev2 is to use Legos online [Makecode Lego Tool](https://makecode.mindstorms.com/). The code uploaded/pasted into the tool is `formula_k.ts`. The central part of the chal is the big data array inside `formula_k.ts`, which represents instructions for the robot to draw out the flag. Players should create an emulator so they can interpret the flag. This array is generated by `create.py`.
