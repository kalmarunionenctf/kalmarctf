# KalmarCTF 2024
Here we will mainly be releasing official writeups for KalmarCTF 2024. Official writeups will not be available from competition end, but will gradually come online by the authors.

## Writeup Competition
We encourage writeups and would like to honor the best 10 writeups with $50 each. In a good writeup we value thoughts and explaination instead of a pure solve scripts without any comments. We like the whole process, including what didnâ€™t work. We don't like writeups created by ChatGPT.

Writeups should be sent to flags@kalmarunionen.dk no later than Sunday, March 24 at 17:00 UTC. Either send the full writeup for us to host, or share a link to your own blog. We will share writeups on Github and Social Media after the submission deadline.

## Firstblood Prizes for Crypto
Three challenges did not get solved during the CTF. As we would like to see solutions to those and to honor the large efforts for those being close to a solve, we are putting out prizes for firstblood on any of the following three challenges:

    Shipwrecked Lattices
    poLy1305CG
    breakfaest

Deadline for submission is March 24 at 17:00 UTC. Contact killerdog@kalmarunionen.dk for submission and proof of solve.

NOTE: All three challenges have been solved!
Congratulations to 
@soon_haari for solving poLy1305CG
@grhkm for solving Shipwrecked Lattices
@Robin_Jadou for solving breakfaest
