#### Kalmarunionen Citizenship Exam
Welcome, aspiring citizen of the Kalmarunionen! To prove your worth, you must pass our rigorous citizenship exam. "What were King Eric's exact thoughts on June 17, 1402, at 3:42 PM?" and "Spell 'Kalmarunionen' backwards using only Viking runes that were lost to history." You have 30 seconds. Unfortunately, the exam is written in an extinct dialect, the grading system is proprietary, you will be judged by an ancient, mysterious algorithm that has never output a passing grade. Held og lykke!

#### Cosmic Flag
We hid the flag in the cosmic background radiation. Somewhere. Your job is to extract it from 13.8 billion years of universal noise. NASA was too slow, but maybe you're faster?

#### 404: Web Challenge Not Found
Your task is simple: exploit a vulnerability in our web server. The catch? There is no web server. No source code, no request logs, nothing. Maybe it's running in another dimension? Maybe you need to curl /dev/null? Or maybe... just maybe... the real web server was the friends we made along the way?

#### CTF Time Travel
The flag was awarded as a special advantage to the top team on CTFtime in 2024. If you were them, congratulations! If not, all you have to do is invent time travel, go back to last year, become the best CTF team in the world, and claim your rightful reward. Shouldn't take more than a few centuries of physics breakthroughs. Get cracking!
