    "description": "Ever played a CTF inside a CTF?\n\nWe were looking for a new scoring algorithm which would both reward top teams for solving super hard challenges, but also ensure that the easiest challenges wouldn't go to minimum straight away if more people played than we expected. \n\nThats when we came across this ingenious suggestion! https://github.com/sigpwny/ctfd-dynamic-challenges-mod/issues/1\n\nWe've implemented it (see [here](https://github.com/blatchley/ctfd-dynamic-challenges-mod) ) and spun up a small test ctf to test it out. \n\nIf you manage to win babykalmarCTF, we'll even give you a flag at /flag!",
