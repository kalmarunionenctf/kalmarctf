Surely you won't be able to leak anything this time?\n\nThe comments in the code could be rather helpful.\nEveryone gets their own instance for this challenge. You can request one here: https://spawn.nix-build-as-a-service.chal-kalmarc.tf/. Don't share your instance link with anyone outside your team!\nTo run the instance locally, unpack the handout and run `nix run .#qemu`. The spawned VM will give you root shell access, as well as bind the web UI at localhost:8080.",
