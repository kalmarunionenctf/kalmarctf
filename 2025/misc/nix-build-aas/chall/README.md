# Rules

- You're ONLY able to:
  - Edit user-input.nix
  - Run ./chall.sh
- This means that you CANNOT:
  - Read ./result
  - Change nix config from the default to anything else
  - Edit any file besides user-input.nix
  - Do anything that's not explicitly permitted by the rules

# Objective
Read flag.txt :)
